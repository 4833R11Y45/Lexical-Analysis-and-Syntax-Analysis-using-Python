# Lexical-Analysis-and-Syntax-Analysis-using-Python
In this assignment, we were assigned to build a lexical and syntax analyzing machine using the RegEx and AST Libraries of Python.
# Regex Library in Python
Regex (AKA Regular Expression) is used to search, display, and manipulate a specific pattern in a string.
# AST Library in Python
AST, which stands for Abstract Syntax Tree, allows a developer to know the pictorial abstraction of the code, even the Python code, itself.
